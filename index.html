    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
      Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water.
      They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up
      to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators.
      Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out.
      As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water
      and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening.
      They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight
      and then continue to graze before dawn.

    <h2>Popularity and meme culture</h2>
    <p>
      Izu Shaboten Zoo and other zoos in Japan have prepared hot spring baths
      for capybaras. Video clips of the bathing capybaras have gained millions
      of views. The capybaras have influenced an anime character named
      Kapibara-san, and a series of merchandise such as plush toys.
      A Capybara cafe has been opened in Tokyo.
